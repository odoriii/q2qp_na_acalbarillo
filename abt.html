            <h1> WHO WE ARE </h1>
            <p> The Philippines have witnessed improved health 
                outcomes in the past years. However, urban-rural 
                disparities are still evident and without addressing
                inequities in accessibility, availability, and 
                affordability of health services, the archipelago 
                of more than 7,000 islands has an uncertain future.
            In 1998, the visionary doctor, Dr. Jaime Z. Galvez Tan 
                founded Health Futures Foundation, Inc. (HFI) to 
                advocate and act in the best interest of the poorest to
                achieve total health and development. Since its 
                inception, HFI have been working towards achieving 
                access, quality, and equity in health and development 
                and acting in the best interest of marginalized and 
                disenfranchised Filipinos. With its extensive experience in health policy and governance, qualitative health research, community mobilization, indigenous health systems assessment, and disaster health management, HFI has been a partner of many national and international agencies and academic institutions in the various facets of Universal and Primary Health Care.

                HFI was incorporated and registered as a non-stock, non-profit, non-government organization with the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998. It is registered as a Donee Institution with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. It is accredited by the Commission on Population and Development. HFI is a member of the Healthy Philippines Alliance and Philippine NGO Council on Population Health and Welfare, Inc. (PNGOC). It is also an accredited Continuing Professional Development Provider of the Professional Regulation Commission.</p>

                    <p>Where do you go when you are sick or feeling ill? Most of us usually go to the hospital or our physicianâ€™s clinic. But for those living in the marginalized rural and far flung areas, the situation is completely different.</p>
